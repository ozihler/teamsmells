Sees himself as the sole authority on any technological subject, and is quick to dismiss any other opinions. He is a rockstar, and he knows it. He is the best at what he does, and is not afraid to let everyone know.
Will pick fights in pull requests or team discussions until he gets his way. He is not afraid to be the only one in the team to disagree with a decision, and will not back down until he gets his way.
Is loved by business especially.
