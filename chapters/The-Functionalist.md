# The Functionalist
## Explanation
Wants to introduce functional programming everywhere they can, 
even though they use object-oriented programming languages.
Builds own frameworks to support functional programming in OOP languages.

## Why is it a problem?
* The functional programing paradigm is not well-known by many developers.
* Implementing a functional programming framework in an object-oriented language like Java may lead to confusions.
* Same issues as with [The Purist](The-Purist.md).

## How to fix it?
* Use a real functional programming language.
* Don't use an OOP language for functional programming.
* Don't write own frameworks if not absolutely necessary, see [The Purist](The-Purist.md).

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* It is okay to combine functional programming paradigms with OOP. 
  For example Java streams follow a functional approach. 
  But the main paradigm should not be sacrificed for the other.

## Questions identify a XY
* What is your opinion on object-oriented programming?

## How does it happen? 
* Senior Dev decides over the heads of the team.
* No clear guidance or goal definition by POs or business.
