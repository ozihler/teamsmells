# The Single Point of Failure
## Explanation
The Single Point of Failure is someone who accumulates all the domain or technical system knowledge, intentionally keeping other team members from contributing or learning. This creates a Single Point of Failure within the team.

## Why is it a problem?
* It leads to bottlenecks in workflows
* Increases risk of failure for the project
* Limits team growth 
* Limited scalability. 
* It also hinders collaboration and knowledge sharing within the team.

## How to fix it?
* Pair and Team Programming with the Single Point of Failure.
* Knowledge transfer sessions (e.g. [Big Picture EventStorming](https://www.eventstormingjournal.com/big%20picture/step-by-step-guide-to-run-your-big-picture-event-storming)) with the Single Point of Failure.
* Promote a culture of open knowledge sharing.
* Implement useful documentation practices (e.g. EventStorming diagram).
* Diversify project responsibilities with each "epic" or story.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Specialized knowledge areas may require focused expertise, but even in these scenarios, sharing knowledge to avoid dependency on a single individual is crucial.

## Questions and Indications to identify a Single Point of Failure
* Is there a reluctance to share knowledge or train others? 
* Has the team experienced a significant setback due to the absence of a specific team member?

## How does it happen?
This behavior can stem from a desire for job security, recognition, or control over work processes.
