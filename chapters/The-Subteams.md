# The Sub-teams
## Explanation
The Sub-teams describes a situation where, within a single team, members form smaller groups focused on specific tasks or areas, such as frontend/backend development or geographic divisions (e.g., CH/NE). This can lead to segmented working practices.

## Why is it a problem?
It may result in communication gaps, knowledge silos, and a lack of cohesive vision or strategy across the team, affecting overall project integration and efficiency.

## How to fix it?
Foster cross-functional collaboration, encourage shared goals, and implement practices like joint planning sessions to bridge divides.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Specialization requires focused groups, but even then, maintaining overarching team unity and communication is crucial.

## Questions and Indications to identify a Sub-teams
Are there isolated clusters within the team?
Is there a lack of shared knowledge or objectives?

## How does it happen?
Organizational structure, project complexity, or cultural differences can lead to subteam formation.
