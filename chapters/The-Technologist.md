solely relies on framework knowledge as a means of measuring seniority
# The Technologist
## Explanation
* Measures seniority solely on programming-language and framework knowledge.
* Think interpersonal issues are best solved with more technology.

## Why is it a problem?
* Many software projects failed even though the entire team was very experienced in the tools they used.
* Frameworks and languages change, but principles, practices, and patterns of writing good software don't.
* Any senior developer should be able to pick up a new language or framework and be productive in a short time.
* Due to newer developments like AI, the need for deep knowledge of a specific language or framework is decreasing.
* Instead, the focus shifts towards software design and refactoring skills.
* A developer may know a language or framework inside out, but still no qualify as a senior dev. 

## How to fix it?
* If a Technologist is a senior dev and shows signs of [a Nerd](The-Nerd.md), it can be very hard to fix without team changes, especially if the entire team is influenced by them.
* A key ingredient is to figure out if the entire team thinks like him or if there are other team members that are not agreeing with him, but are too shy to raise their voices (see [The Silent One](The-Silent-One.md)).
* Introduce Domain-Driven Design, Refactoring, Clean Code, and other high-level software engineering practices to the team.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* Knowing a language or framework deeply is not a bad thing, but it should not be the only measure of seniority.
* The more senior a developer gets, the less important specific framework knowledge and languages become compared to other aspects of software engineering.

## Questions to identify a Technologist
* What makes a senior developer for you?

## How does it happen?
* Values and interests solely on low-level technology, not on high-level principles and patterns.
* It's simple to measure compared to high-level, fuzzy software engineering concepts.
* Nobody in the team has heard of these higher level practices.
* Interest may be there to learn it, but business typically doesn't care about it (as it's not their field of expertise). I the team consists of [Yes Sayers](The-Yes-Sayers.md), they will sacrifice their own interests for more features and focus on quantitative implementation rather than qualitative design.
