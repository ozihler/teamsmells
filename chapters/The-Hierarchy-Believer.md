# The Hierarchy Believer
## Explanation
The Hierarchy Believer prioritizes and values team members based on their rank or status within the organization, often mistreating or ignoring those they perceive as lower-ranked, while seeking approval from those in higher positions or with greater status.

## Why is it a problem?
This behavior creates a toxic work environment, undermines team cohesion, and discourages open communication and collaboration. It can lead to decreased morale among team members who feel undervalued or disrespected.

## How to fix it?
Promote a culture of equality where all team members are respected and valued for their contributions, regardless of their position. Leadership should model inclusive behavior and address any instances of hierarchy-based discrimination.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Respecting authority and recognizing expertise is important, but it should not lead to differential treatment that undermines team unity and respect.

## Questions and Indications to identify a Hierarchy Believer
* Are certain team members consistently overlooked or undervalued?
* Is there a pattern of deference to authority that hampers honest feedback or collaboration?

## How does it happen?
This behavior can stem from organizational cultures that excessively emphasize hierarchical structures or from personal insecurities and ambitions.
