# The Purist
## Explanation
A senior dev in the team that insists on implementing everything themselves instead of using a well-established framework.

## Why is it a problem?
* Bugs likely due to lack of testing. 
* Slowdown as new devs need to learn the framework which typically lacks documentation.
* If something breaks, the team is stuck waiting for the senior dev to fix it.

## How to fix it?
* Short term: 
  * Pair and Team programming with the senior dev to learn their framework.
  * Encourage the senior dev to write a comprehensive documentation and tests.
* Mid- to Long term:
  * Introduce a well-established framework.
* In any case: deal with [a Nerd](The-Nerd.md) appropriately.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* If there is no framework available.
* If the available framework is not suitable for the project.
* If the available framework's expenses are higher than the costs of implementing it in-house (debatable).
* If the in-house framework is a core subdomain that solves the problem the established framework solves in a new and exciting way (e.g. AI replacing Google Search).

## Questions and Indications to identify a Purist
* Which frameworks do you use here (if they mention an in-house framework, this is the lead to inquire further)?
* Who maintains the in-house framework? (identifies the purists, because the rest of the team will not want to do that typically).
* What is the reason for implementing this in-house? (indications (but not proof) for acceptable answers are the ones mentioned in the edge cases section).
* Alternative: why not use a well-established framework? / Why not use framework XY (if known).

## How does it happen?
* No clear guidance or goal definition during team forming.
* Absent business interest or assumption that the team will just know what they need to do.
* Absent or weak peer pressure to use a well-established framework.
* Purist always wanted to implement such a framework.
* Other topics are too boring for the Purist.
