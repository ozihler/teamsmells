# The Purist
## Explanation
A senior dev in the team that insists on implementing everything themselves instead of using a well-established framework.

## Why is it a problem?
* Bugs likely due to lack of testing.
  * Increased risk if the senior dev is also [a Pragmatist](The-Pragmatist.md) or [a Hacker](The-Hacker.md).
* Slowdown as new devs need to learn the framework which typically lacks documentation.
  * Increased if the senior dev is also [a Nerd](The-Nerd.md).
* If something breaks, the team is stuck waiting for the senior dev to fix it.

## How to fix it?
* Short term: 
  * Pair and Team programming with the senior dev to learn their framework.
  * Encourage the senior dev to write a comprehensive documentation and tests.
* Mid- to Long term:
  * Introduce a well-established framework.
* In any case:
  * Deal with [the Nerd](The-Nerd.md) appropriately.
  * Encourage [a Pragmatist](The-Pragmatist.md) to learn the value of abstractions.
  * Encourage [a Hacker](The-Hacker.md) to see the long-term consequences of their quick fixes.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* If there is no framework available.
* If the available framework is not suitable for the project.
* If the available framework's expenses are higher than the costs of implementing it in-house (debatable).
* If the in-house framework is a core subdomain that solves the problem the established framework solves in a new and exciting way (e.g. AI replacing Google Search).

## Questions identify a Purist
* Who maintains the in-house framework?
* What is the reason for implementing this in-house?
* Why not use a well-established framework?

## How does it happen?
* No clear guidance or goal definition during team forming.
* Absent business interest or assumption that the team will just know what they need to do.
* Absent or weak peer pressure to use a well-established framework.
* Purist always wanted to implement such a framework.
* Other topics are too boring for the Purist.
