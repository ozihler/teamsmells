# The Alumnus
## Explanation
Uses lots of Design Patterns they learnt in Uni but that aren't useful to create maintainable business software.

## Why is it a problem?
* Not everybody knows every GoF Design Pattern inside out.
* They typically are reasonable when implemented, but become hard to maintain quickly after.
* Other practices like Clean Code, Code Smell identification, Refactoring, and Domain-Driven Design yield better results for maintainability.

## How to fix it?
* Tell them to avoid using Design Patterns in business software as much as possible.
* Introduce them to Clean Code, Code Smells, Refactoring, and Domain-Driven Design instead.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* If the application to build is a framework that requires lots of hooks and extension capabilities.

## Questions and Indications to identify an Alumnus
* What kind of Design Patterns do you use in the current codebase?

## How does it happen?
* At uni, you learn Design Patterns in depth, but not Clean Code, Code Smells, Refactoring, and Domain-Driven Design.
