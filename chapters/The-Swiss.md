# The Swiss
## Explanation
"The Swiss" refers to a team member who expects others to understand their thoughts and intentions without direct communication, relying on contextual cues and implicit understanding. This expectation can lead to misunderstandings, especially with team members from more direct cultural backgrounds unaccustomed to this implicit communication style.

## Why is it a problem?
Assumptions based on non-direct communication can lead to confusion, misalignment of goals, and inefficiencies in collaboration, particularly in diverse teams where clear communication is key to mutual understanding and effective cooperation.

## How to fix it?
Foster an environment that values explicit communication, provide training on effective communication strategies, and encourage team members to seek clarification when needed to ensure all are aligned and misunderstandings are minimized.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
In teams with a long history of working together, some level of non-verbal understanding may develop naturally. However, clear and direct communication should still be the norm, especially in critical or complex matters.

## Questions and Indications to identify a
Are there frequent misunderstandings or misinterpretations of intentions within the team?
Do some team members seem to operate based on assumptions rather than clear instructions or discussions?

## How does it happen?
It may arise from cultural differences in communication styles or from an individual's belief in the efficiency of non-verbal cues over explicit discussions.
