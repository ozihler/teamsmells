# The BFFs
## Explanation
BFFs (Best Friends Forever) occur when two or multiple team members consistently work together on projects or tasks and barely engage with other team members.
BFFs are based on personal preferences and relationships rather than professional or objective reasons. 

## Why is it a problem? 
* If the BFFs feel mistreated, ranting within the BFF group can spiral into "us vs. them" thinking within the team, essentially breaking team cohesion apart.
* Reduced Collaboration and Communication: Other team members may feel excluded, leading to decreased overall team cohesion and communication.
* Knowledge Silos: Essential knowledge and skills may become concentrated within the BFF group, hindering knowledge sharing and distribution across the team.
* Biased Decision-Making: Decisions may be influenced more by the preferences and perspectives of the BFF group rather than the best interests of the project or organization.
* Decreased Team Morale: Perceived favoritism or exclusion can lead to decreased morale and engagement among team members who are not part of the BFF group.

## How to fix it?
* Encourage Cross-Team Collaboration: Implement team-building activities and projects that require cross-team collaboration to break down existing cliques.
* Rotate Project Teams: Regularly rotate team members across different projects to encourage diverse interactions and reduce dependency on specific individuals.
* Foster an Inclusive Culture: Promote an inclusive culture that values diversity of thought and encourages team members to engage with everyone.
* Transparent Communication: Ensure transparent communication and decision-making processes that involve input from all team members.
* Leadership Training: Provide training for team leaders to recognize and mitigate exclusionary behaviors and to promote inclusivity.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* Overall, it is okay to favor some individuals, as long as they are inclusive towards all the other team members and actively incorporate them in their work.
* Specialized Projects: When a project requires specialized skills or knowledge that a particular group of individuals possesses. However, knowledge sharing is key to avoid the bus factor.
* Efficiency and Productivity: Short-term collaborations that leverage existing work relationships for efficiency without undermining team cohesion.
* Mentorship and Training: When the purpose is to facilitate mentorship, where a more experienced team member pairs with a less experienced one for training.

## Questions and Indications to identify BFFs
* Are there team members who consistently work together to the exclusion of others?
* Is there a lack of diversity in team collaboration and idea generation?
* Do certain team members always support each other's ideas without considering alternatives?
* Is there evidence of knowledge silos within the team?

## How does it happen?
* The BFFs phenomenon typically develops over time as individuals gravitate towards working with those they feel most comfortable with, often due to shared interests, working styles, or personal relationships.
* This behavior can be inadvertently encouraged by leadership styles that do not actively promote inclusivity or by organizational cultures that do not value diversity of collaboration.
