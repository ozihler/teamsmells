# The Inverter
## Explanation
The Inverter is someone who, after making a statement, later insists they didn't mean it the way it was originally perceived, creating confusion about their true intentions or statements. This behavior can be similar to gaslighting, as it involves altering the perceived reality of interactions.

## Why is it a problem?
This practice undermines trust and clarity within the team. It can lead to communication breakdowns, decreased morale, and an environment where team members feel uncertain and hesitant to express their thoughts or take actions.

## How to fix it?
Promote a culture of clear, honest communication and accountability. Encourage team members to seek clarification when misunderstandings occur and to address discrepancies in statements directly and constructively.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Miscommunications happen, and clarifying one's intent is necessary when genuine misunderstandings arise. However, consistently altering the narrative for one's advantage is disruptive.

## Questions and Indications to identify a
* Are there recurring instances where someone's statements are later denied or reinterpreted?
* Do these behaviors create confusion or distrust among team members?

## How does it happen?
This behavior may stem from a desire to avoid conflict, accountability, or from a lack of confidence in one's opinions and decisions.

The main difference is that the inverter not necessarily knows that they do it and may especially try to avoid conflicts, while the gas-lighter actively tries to manipulate people.
