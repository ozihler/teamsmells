The Team of Individuals
Explanation
This refers to a group that, despite being labeled a "scrum team," operates more as separate entities than a cohesive unit. Members work on their tasks independently and only communicate with each other when absolutely necessary.

Why is it a problem?
This lack of collaboration and communication can lead to missed opportunities for innovation, inefficiencies in workflow, and a fragmented team dynamic, ultimately impacting the quality and success of projects.

How to fix it?
Encourage regular team meetings, promote pair or mob programming sessions, and create shared goals that require collective effort to achieve, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration.

Edge cases - when is it ok?
While independence is valuable for certain tasks requiring deep focus, the essence of a scrum team lies in collaboration and shared responsibility.

Questions and Indications to identify a
Do team members lack awareness of each other's work?
Is there minimal interaction or knowledge sharing among the team?
How does it happen?
It can result from a lack of clear team goals, insufficient leadership in promoting team values, or individual preferences for working solo.

"The pseudo pair programmer": Tells everybody they pair programmed, but what they actually meant is that they may only have clarified with another developer briefly what there is to do, then worked the entire time on their own, and sporadically may involve other team members for a brief time if they are stuck

The Pseudo Pair Programmer
Explanation
"The Pseudo Pair Programmer" claims to engage in pair programming but, in reality, only consults briefly with colleagues before working solo. They might only seek help when facing a blockage, thus not truly engaging in continuous collaborative coding.

Why is it a problem?
This approach misses the benefits of true pair programming, such as enhanced learning opportunities, improved code quality, and increased team cohesion.

How to fix it?
Promote genuine pair programming practices, establish clear expectations for what pair programming entails, and encourage a culture of collaboration.

Edge cases - when is it ok?
Brief consultations can be part of the process, but they shouldn't replace the continuous collaborative effort true pair programming requires.

Questions and Indications to identify a
Is there a discrepancy between claimed and observed pair programming practices?
Do team members frequently work in isolation despite claims of collaboration?
How does it happen?
It may stem from misunderstandings about pair programming, reluctance to share control, or a preference for independent work.
