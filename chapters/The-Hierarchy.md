# The Hierarchy
## Explanation
"The Hierarchy" refers to a team structure where roles and responsibilities are strictly defined and ranked, typically with the Scrum Master (ScM) and Product Owner (PO) acting as team leads, and developers positioned below them in the hierarchy, often aligned according to their titles.

## Why is it a problem?
This rigid structure can stifle creativity and collaboration, discourage team autonomy, and create barriers to open communication. It may lead to a lack of empowerment among team members, reducing their ability to innovate and take initiative.

## How to fix it?
Promote a more flat and collaborative team structure where ideas and contributions are valued equally, regardless of title. Encourage leadership roles to act more as facilitators than directors, focusing on empowering team members and fostering a culture of shared responsibility.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
In certain contexts, a hierarchical structure may be necessary for clarity of decision-making or in highly regulated industries. However, even in these scenarios, promoting elements of collaboration and empowerment within the hierarchy can enhance team dynamics.

## Questions and Indications to identify a
* Is decision-making centralized with little input from the team?
* Do team members hesitate to contribute ideas or raise concerns?
* Is there a clear divide between "management" and "staff"?

## How does it happen?
Organizational culture, industry norms, or leadership styles can contribute to the establishment and maintenance of hierarchical team structures.
