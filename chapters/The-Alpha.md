# The Alpha
## Explanation
When they raise their voice, everyone else is silent.
They typically don't know of their role or that they are perceived like that.

## Why is it a problem?
* Others may feel intimidated.
* Others may not raise concerns even though they are legitimate.

## How to fix it?
* Talk to the Alpha. Usually, talking about the observation is enough to make them aware and hopefully adapt.
* Behavior change may take time, so raise the concern again if it repeats.
* A safe place in the retro and 1:1 with affected team members may also help.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* If the Alpha uses their power and influence to protect the team from outside forces.

## Questions and Indications to identify an Alpha
* Who would you recognise as the most influential team member? (they will typically point to an Alpha).
* Who's the one everyone turns to if they have a problem?
* Who's the one typically regarded as the "talent" in the team?

## How does it happen?
* Unawareness.
* Lack of self-reflection.
* Missing psychological safety.
* Missing feedback culture.
