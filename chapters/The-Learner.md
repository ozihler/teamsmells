# The Learner
## Explanation
Learners introduce every new technology they come across into the project, even if it's not necessary.

## Why is it a problem?
* Not everyone in the team may understand all intricacies of the new technology.
* The complexity of the system increases accidentally. 
* Decisions are taken purely based on the technology, not on the business value.

## How to fix it?
* Limit the number of technologies used in a project.
* Identify key technology stacks most of the team is comfortable with and stick to it.
* Focus on creating business value, not on solely learning new technologies.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
* Introducing new technologies may increase team member happiness, but it should be done deliberately.
* Teams suffering through Legacy applications can get a boost in motivation if they can also work on greenfield projects with new technologies.

## Questions and Indications to identify a Learner
* What is your main motivation to work in the team? (Learning new technologies)
* What kind of technologies do you use in the current codebase? (A lot of different ones)

## How does it happen?
* There is no decision-making process, peer pressure, or other oversight to limit the number of technologies used in a project.
