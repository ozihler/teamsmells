# The Subordinate
## Explanation
The Subordinate is characterized by taking pressure from higher management and passing it onto the team. Often, Product Owners (POs) or Scrum Masters (ScMs) can fall into this role, contrary to their responsibility to protect and shield the team from such pressures.

## Why is it a problem?
This behavior can lead to increased stress and decreased morale within the team, undermining the team's ability to work effectively and collaboratively.

## How to fix it?
Encourage POs and ScMs to adopt a shielding role, absorbing external pressures while promoting a supportive and stress-managed environment for the team.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Direct communication of external pressures is sometimes necessary for transparency but should be done in a way that does not unduly burden the team.

## Questions and Indications to identify a

## How does it happen?
This can occur in highly hierarchical organizations or in teams where the PO or ScM lacks the skills or confidence to effectively manage upward pressures.
