# The Daily Status Meeting
## Explanation
The Daily Status Meeting refers to daily stand-up meetings intended for feedback and day-planning that devolve into mere status updates. 
The pattern can extend to other Agile or Scrum ceremonies, where the focus narrows to reporting on tasks rather than facilitating meaningful discussion, collaboration, or planning.

## Why is it a problem?
* **Missed Opportunities for Improvement**: Focusing solely on status updates misses the chance to address issues, gather feedback, and identify improvement opportunities.
* **Lack of Engagement**: Meetings become monotonous, leading to disengaged participants who see little value in the process.
* **Ineffective Communication**: Essential discussions on obstacles, collaboration needs, and planning for the day are sidelined.

## How to fix it?
* **Ask the 3 questions**: what did I do yesterday, what do I plan to do today, and are there any blockers?
* **Encourage Interaction**: Shift the focus towards interactive discussions that include feedback, blockers, and collaborative solutions.
* **Focus on Goals**: Align meetings with the objective of planning and improvement, not just reporting.
* **Limit Status Updates**: Encourage brief, relevant updates, and move detailed discussions to smaller, focused groups as needed.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?
Brief status updates are valuable for transparency and alignment but should not overshadow the meeting's primary purpose of fostering feedback, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

## Questions and Indications to identify a
* Are meetings predominantly comprised of task reporting?
* Is there little to no discussion on collaboration or planning?
* Do participants seem disengaged or see the meeting as a superfluous formality?

## How does it happen?
This issue often arises from a misunderstanding of the meeting's purpose, leading to a routine focus on task progress at the expense of valuable communication and planning opportunities.
