The Leaders
Explanation
"The Leaders" refers to an exclusive group within the team, usually comprised of the Scrum Master (ScM), Product Owner (PO), and senior developers, who make critical decisions affecting the team's direction and work. They are the primary attendees in important meetings.

This exclusivity can lead to a lack of transparency, reduced team engagement, and a feeling of disenfranchisement among other team members, potentially stifling innovation and collaborative spirit.

How to fix it?
Encourage inclusive decision-making processes that involve the whole team, utilize transparent communication channels, and ensure all members have opportunities to contribute to discussions and decisions.
