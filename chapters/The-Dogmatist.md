# The Dogmatist
## Explanation

Believe in some writers or famous programmers and blindly try to force that knowledge on every project or team even
though they have no proof of it actually working.

## Why is it a problem?

* There are no silver bullets in software development, every decision is context dependent, and there are trade-offs in any decisions.
* Every project and team is different.
* Every conceptual idea is subject to interpretation, and also the Dogmatist only has a subjective view on the matter.

## How to fix it?

* Encourage the Dogmatist to see the world through a more gray lens.
* Demonstrate cases where the Dogmatist's ideas would likely not work.
* Brainstorm possible consequences of the Dogmatist's idea.
* Encourage the team to try out the Dogmatist's ideas in a controlled environment and evaluate the results.

## Edge cases - when is it ok?

* The Dogmatist's ideas are typically well intended. The real world is just not as black and white as they think, and
  software engineering is always about balancing trade-offs.

## Questions and Indications to identify a Dogmatist
Listen for phrases like:
* "We should not use microservices because Amazon merged theirs as well".
* "Vertical Sliced Architecture is the only way to go".
* "We need stateful domain models everywhere", even in simple CRUD applications.

## How does it happen?
* Black and white thinking patterns.
* Lack of experience in the field.
* Burned by a previous project and now overcompensating.

## Related Smells
* A Dogmatist is like a [Theorist](The-Theorist.md) that forces their ideas on others and the team.
